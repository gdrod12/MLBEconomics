\title{Combine game information with ballpark capacity data}
\usage{
combine_ballpark_data(year)
}
\arguments{
\item{year}{Integer. The season year for which to scrape contemporary
ballpark capacity data (e.g., `2024`).}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns:
\describe{

\description{
This function merges Retrosheet game information (from `gameinfo.csv`)
with ballpark capacity data scraped from \url{https://www.seamheads.com/ballparks/}.
The result is a dataset that links individual games with stadium capacities
and associated weather/field conditions.
}
\details{
- The function reads `gameinfo.csv` from the packageâ€™s `extdata/` folder.
- Ballpark capacity data is obtained from \code{\link{scrape_old_ballparks}}.
- The two datasets are merged by `site` (game location) and `season` (game year).
