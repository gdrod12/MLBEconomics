\title{Scrape historical and contemporary ballpark data}
\usage{
scrape_old_ballparks(year)
}
\arguments{
\item{year}{Integer. The season year for which to scrape contemporary
ballpark data (e.g., `2024`).}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns:
\describe{
  \item{Ballpark Name}{Character. Name of the ballpark.}
  \item{Capacity}{Character/numeric. Reported seating capacity.}
  \item{team_id}{Character. Team identifier extracted from the seamheads URL.}
  \item{Year}{Integer. Year associated with the ballpark entry.}
}
}
\description{
This function scrapes ballpark information from
\url{https://www.seamheads.com/ballparks/}. It retrieves inactive
ballpark capacity data across teams as well as contemporary
(active) ballpark data for a given year, and merges them into a single
dataset.
}
\details{
The function performs two scrapes:
\itemize{
  \item Inactive ballparks: visits each historical team link from the
  seamheads ballparks index and extracts ballpark capacity data.
  \item Active ballparks: retrieves the main ballpark table for the
  specified year.
}
The two datasets are then combined and returned.
